# Description

Implementations of [Fibonacci Heaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap) and [Hollow Heaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06535). These data structures allow better amortized running times than many other priority queue data structures. Using them for priority queues improves the asymptotic running time of important algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, compared to the same algorithm using other slower priority queue data structures.
